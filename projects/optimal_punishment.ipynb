    "# Assumptions\n",
    "- The first assumption is that innocent people imprisoned/rehabilitated/executed will not commit a crime, thus their costs do not need to be taken into account.\n",
    "- The effects of rehab reset after each instance of a crime.\n",
    "- Inter-crime times are exponentially distributed.\n",
    "- Crimes cannot be commited while in prison or in rehab.\n",
    "- Criminals will only recommit the same crime they previously committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis\n",
    "Here is where we will decide, how should we punish the criminal? This is entirely dependent on the parameters, let's go through each:\n",
    "- $C_c$) As the cost of the crime increases, the cost of a reoccurrence will increase, driving longer sentences (for both rehab and prison). This makes both less desirable to the death penalty. The opposite is also true.\n",
    "-  As the relative costs of each $C_R, C_P, C_D, C_RW, C_PW, C_DW$  change, the result will change accordingly. As a punishment becomes relatively cheaper compared to it's peers, it will become more favorable. The opposite is also true.\n",
    "- $r$) The discount rate is an interesting one. As the discount rate increases, the death penalty becomes less favorable, as do long prison/rehab sentences. This is because the future becomes less important in the calculation. This could be seen due to societies expecting growth or just short-sighted members of society. Of course, the opposite is also true, low discount rates indicate the society weighs the future (increasingly) equal to the present. A negative discount rate might even show a society willing to endure costs in the present for their ancestors.\n",
    "- $p$) As $p$ increases, we start to see closer and closer to what the society truly feels about their options and their criminal's value. A high $p$ will favor the death penalty far more. A low $p$ would likely favor prison sentences over rehab (as the individual is already in prison, there's no reason to rehabilitate them if they are fine).\n",
    "- $L$) $L$ is an interesting one, it points heavily towards prison sentences in the low end, and points far more towards the death penalty as it increases. More can be said about $L$ in the discussion of $\\lambda$.\n",
    " - $\\lambda$) The relative rates of $\\lambda$ are perhaps one of the most important parameters. As $\\lambda$ relatively increases for any of the penalties, it becomes far less favorable. Additionally, for rehab or prison, the effect the time parameter has on $\\lambda$ makes a huge difference in the behavior of the model. How much experiencing rehab affects your rate of recidivism makes a massive difference to the value of rehab. This also comes into play with $L$, as $\\lambda$ becomes relatively larger compared to $L$, the option becomes increasingly more attractive. Interestingly, the death penalty might be the only option that doesn't exhibit that behavior. If all $\\lambda$ values increase, the death penalty will seem less useful, as you will save less (relatively) by not having to deal with recidivism."
